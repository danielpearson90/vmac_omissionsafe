| fixationPropGoodSamples | Proportion of gaze samples in fixation period that are marked as "valid" by the Tobii system |
| fixationTimeout | 0 = no fixation timeout, 1 = fixation timeout (i.e., 5000 ms without sufficient gaze on fixation AOI) |
| trialPropGoodSamples | Proportion of gaze samples in trial period that are marked as "valid" by the Tobii system |
| timeout | 0 = no trial timeout, 1 = trial timeout (i.e., 2000 ms without sufficient gaze on target) |
| softTimeoutTrial | 0 = no "soft timeout", 1 = trial "soft timeout" (i.e., 1000 ms without sufficient gaze on target) |
