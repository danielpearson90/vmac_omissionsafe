# processed_data

This folder contains the cleaned data sets, which are generated automatically using the scripts in the [preprocessing](../preprocessing) folder. 

There are also three explanatory "notes" files, which explain the variables stored in each column of the behav_data, eye_data, and saccade_angle_data files.
